# CTF Write Ups

This folder contains write-ups from CTF competitions and practices I've participated in, including PicoCTF and the Cyber Sentinel Challenge.

Each folder corresponds to a specific event and includes:
- Challenge descriptions
- Tools used (e.g., strings, Ghidra, Burp Suite)
- Step-by-step problem solving
- Flag capture where appropriate
