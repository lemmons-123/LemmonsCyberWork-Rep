# Anti-Siphon Webinars Notes Collection

This repository houses notes and lab summaries from various Anti-Siphon webinars I’ve attended. Each folder focuses on a different session or instructor, with emphasis on practical, actionable takeaways. I’m revising these over time as I revisit the material or apply it in hands-on labs.

## Completed Write-Ups:
- **ADCD – Day 4 (Jon Strand)**  
  Legal and ethical boundaries of cyber deception, Canarytokens, and SMB honeypots.

## In Progress:
- **CIS Controls 18: Audit Prep to Reporting**  
  Breakdown of CIS 18 implementation groups, audit prep strategy, stakeholder interviews, and evidence gathering.

- **Rapid Endpoint & Triage Investigation (Patterson Cake)**  
  Practical workflow for endpoint triage using Velociraptor, KAPE, and PowerShell; analysis through the lens of the CPR model (Collect, Parse, Refine).

## Goal:
To build a curated, hands-on reference for defensive ops and incident response workflows, especially for entry-level and intermediate analysts looking to upskill.
