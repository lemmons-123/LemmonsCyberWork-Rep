# CVSS to EPSS Notes

[Advancements in Vulnerability Assessment: The Shift from CVSS to EPSS and the Role of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework | by ZENcurity | Technology Hits | Medium](https://medium.com/technology-hits/advancements-in-vulnerability-assessment-the-shift-from-cvss-to-epss-and-the-role-of-the-mitre-b029bfffee03)

- An apparent shift from the Common vuln. Scoring System (CVSS) to the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)
- CVSS 4.0 is under development
    - Better scoring precision
    - Threat Intelligence
    - More Vuln types
- Limitations of CVSS
    - Overreliance on Technical Metrics
    - Slow Adaptation & Static nature of scoring
    - Framework provides generic assessments
- EPSS uses a logical regression model to provide a more dynamic vulnerability assessment
- Benefits of EPSS
    - Enhanced Predictive Capabilities
    - Dynamic Risk Assessments
    - Context-Sensitive Evaluations
