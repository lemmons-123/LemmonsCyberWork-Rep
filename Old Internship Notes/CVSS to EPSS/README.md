# From CVSS to EPSS – Vulnerability Scoring Research Notes

These notes summarize my personal research on the transition from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). I explored the limitations of static scoring systems and the emerging role of data-driven, predictive approaches.

### Topics Covered

- Key weaknesses in CVSS 3.x and goals of CVSS 4.0
- EPSS’s use of machine learning and real-world exploit data
- Comparative strengths: dynamic scoring, contextual awareness, and exploit likelihood
- MITRE ATT&CK’s role in vulnerability analysis

These notes supported my understanding of risk assessment in vulnerability management frameworks and helped shape my thinking for future GRC work.
