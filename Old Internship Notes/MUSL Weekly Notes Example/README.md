# Week 13 Internship Log â€“ Security Engineering @ MUSL

As part of my cybersecurity internship at the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), I maintained structured weekly logs using Notion. These logs captured key activities, learning progress, security research, and technical tasks.

This file contains a cleaned-up example (Week 13) to demonstrate how I organized my work and learning. Tasks during this week included:

- Deepfake awareness training presentation prep
- FLEX system automation account audits
- Hands-on labs in Windows Attack & Defense
- Monitoring industry threats and malware trends

These logs helped me stay accountable, reflect on my growth, and track technical depth throughout the internship.
