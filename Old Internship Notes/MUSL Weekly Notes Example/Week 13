# Week 13

This is a cleaned and summarized example of my weekly learning journal maintained during my cybersecurity internship at the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). I used Notion to track key activities, tasks, security news, and personal progress throughout the internship.

Week 13 was heavy on presentation prep and systems hygiene. I learned how seemingly small misconfigurations (like orphaned accounts or old scripts) can lead to big problems in enterprise systems. The security news also drove home the point that attackers will abuse *anything* — even Minecraft mods — if it gets the job done. That kind of creativity is exactly what we need to defend against.
