# Executive Security Awareness Training â€“ Deepfake Social Engineering Demo

During ths project, I worked on a security awareness presentation targeting executive leadership. The goal was to demonstrate how deepfake technology could be weaponized in corporate social engineering attacks.

### Overview

- Created a simulated deepfake voice/video attack using DeepFaceLab
- Designed a visual presentation to educate executives on how deepfakes are made and used
- Integrated live demos, case studies (e.g., UK CFO attack), and defensive best practices
- Presented to internal leadership to raise awareness and drive adoption of verification protocols

### Tools Used

- DeepFaceLab
- Notion (script development + planning)
- Microsoft Prezi
- KnowBe4 (for defensive training references)

### Note

All files are sanitized of real names and internal details. This project serves as an example of how cybersecurity awareness can intersect with red team thinking and public threat education.
